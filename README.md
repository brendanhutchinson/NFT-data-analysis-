# NFT-data-analysis-
This is an analysis of the current NFT marketplace and NFT sales since 2017.

my data was collected via scraping opeansea.com for the top 100 selling nft collections then with this information the
OpeanSea api was accessed to get various stats on price, amount in collection and market growth over one month. 
additionally i used two seperate data sets from kaggle History of Nfts, and NFT sales.

My exploratory data analysis looks at the top 20 selling collections listed on opean sea at the moment 
analyzes the growth of the NFT market since 2017 and focused on the exponential increase seen aroung august of 2021. 

I take into account the emergence of various types of NFTs that have influenced this growth, and some stats on the average price and amount of nfts listed within each collection.

Due to the disparity in NFT values and the quantity of nfts produces, i display the effect that a single nft within a collection can have on the overall NFT market growth.

To understand the motives behind NFT sales or whether or not the active market wallets are interested  in buying or selling , similar to stocks or for collection and social purposes. to achieve this understanding i looked a the difference between secondary and primary sales both over time and between collections. 

Overall NFT sales are expected to continue increaseing due to increase in interested buyers, new innovation within the nft space, and the immense potential of the blockchain
